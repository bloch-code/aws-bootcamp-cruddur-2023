# Week 0 — Billing and Architecture
## What I have achieved
I watched all the videos required to get up to speed with my homework. This helped me to refresh my cloud knowledge and get me up to speed ahead of second lecture. 
* Pricing Basics and Free tier
* AWS calculator and other concepts of budgets and spending explored
* Understand AWS free tier
* Cloud security – I found this as an interesting topic. Good point noted that we don’t need to fill in all the gaps especially in one go BUT me and the company I work for need to know about all the risks
* Learned about concept of organization unit whitin AWS
* I learned a useful tip to use tags to help track logs etc. for security and debug or audit purpose and to track where data goes to
* It was a usefuel session to get refresh knowledge of roles and policies and IAM + MFA purpose

## GitHub and repos
To get ready for the course I did prepare my local environment and cloned Andrew repo to my folder. This ended up to be a useful exercise to then push my repo / folder to github from my PC and update my GitHub account that way. When I have cloned Andrew repo I did not realis that when I would try to push code it will go to his repo. To allo code to go to my repo I had to change the origin URL to my own GitHub account repo and this allowed me to push it directly from my local machine. 

I have successfully connected to Gitpod and my VSCode desktop app.

It was a good advice from Andrew to do a sanity check on which account you’re logged in to make sure you apply settings to desire account and user. 

I have installed AWS CLI for windows – I know don’t judge me for using Windows.

I have accidentally installed AWS in the  github / gitpod repo as I went to quick with Andrew instructions. It was solved by removing installation following instructions on how to remove AWS CLI from Linux.

I find out what CAT means which is …concatenate. It does display content of the file.
Learned how to save my variables to gitpod using “gp env export”.

I have struggled to push code to repo from VSC desktop. It was down to set permission to allow gitpod to publish to public repo.

I have learned to run a query to get specific details from my AWS account.

I created budget and SNS using CLI.

I have tagged my code using git tag command.

Also, I create two diagrams.
