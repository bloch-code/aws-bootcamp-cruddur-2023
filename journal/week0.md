# Week 0 — Billing and Architecture
## What I have achieved
I watched all the videos required to get up to speed with my homework. This helped me to refresh my cloud knowledge and get me up to speed ahead of second lecture. 
* Pricing Basics and Free tier
* AWS calculator and other concepts of budgets and spending explored
* Understand AWS free tier
* Cloud security – I found this as an interesting topic. Good point noted that we don’t need to fill in all the gaps especially in one go BUT me and the company I work for need to know about all the risks
*
