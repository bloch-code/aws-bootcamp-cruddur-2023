# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

1. All docker files created successfully 
2. Backend and front end are working correctly as expected both on gitpod browser and on my local machine
3. I have successfully created a notification page and hardcoded messages to the back end that display correctly on the website. 
During the videos and self practice I have manage to mixed up a code and linked backend ```py``` notification page to home page and it took me a few min to figure it out why do I see same messages on both.

4. DynamoDB and Postgrate databases both have been set up correctly.

container composer doers install everything as it should.

One challenge that I found was that not all the function of gitpod and browser VSCode extensions worked for me in Firefox.

Switching to Chrome resolved the PostgrateSQL extension issue as well as not being able to see ports in the ports tab.

Also, today I was working from different machine to the one I normally worked on and this helped me realise again how ```.yml``` files work and how helpful they are same as container files. I didn't have to change a lot to get Cruddur app up and running. 

## Summary

This week again I was able to practice my CLI and git and gitpod commands and get more familiar with all of them. 
During this two weeks I have learned how to use markdown language and upload images to my journal. I have better understanding of what is required for grading and how to come over challenges and obstacles.

What I need to focus more is to get more active on discord as community is there and people are very helpful and friendly. So far I have been able to resolve any issues without bigger problems or delays. I m getting better understanding of cloud infrastructure and how the system works and talk to each other. 
This shows me more in depth how cloud engineer might look like for me in the future as this is a career path that I would like to take.
