# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

**What is it and how it differs from normal auth?**

I started by getting more understanding of what the decentralised auth do.

*Centralized identity management means IAM all happens in one environment. In a workplace setting, this looks like the user signing into a single workspace to access all the applications and tools they need. Decentralized identity management means IAM is spread out across multiple environments.*

*With decentralized authentication, also known as distributed identity management, users
access applications individually using a different set of credentials for each. This model
distributes users&#39; identities across the network, as each application must store and handle
its own user data.*

## Backend authentication in cognito.

For this we have passed authentication token to our backend to authentication. 
With little help from StackOverflow we were able to implement our backend.

No server side auth verification required. All is handled by Congito! that's so much easier and quicker.

**Following along....**

Good thing is that following Andrew he makes mistakes too and realised this errors much later. This is good learning experience to pay attention to details also good one for debugging.
